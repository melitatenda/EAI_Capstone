Course description
This course focuses on policy issues related to privacy from the perspectives of governments, organizations, and individuals. 
We will begin with a historical and philosophical study of privacy and then explore recent public policy issues. 
We will examine the privacy protections provided by laws and regulations, as well as the way technology can be used to protect privacy. 
We will emphasize technology-related privacy concerns and mitigation, for example: social networks, smartphones, 
behavioral advertising (and tools to prevent targeted advertising and tracking), anonymous communication systems, big data, and drones. 
Programming skills are not required. This course will include a lot of reading, writing, and class discussion. 
Students will be able to tailor their assignments to their skills and interests, focusing more on programming or writing papers as they see fit. 
However, all students will be expected to do some writing and some technical work. 
A large emphasis will be placed on research and communication skills, which will be taught throughout the course.
